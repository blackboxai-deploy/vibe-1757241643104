# Location Tracking Website - Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Database & API Setup
- [ ] Install additional dependencies (Prisma, SQLite, uuid)
- [ ] Setup Prisma with SQLite database
- [ ] Create database schema (TrackedLinks, LocationData)
- [ ] Initialize database

## Phase 2: API Development
- [ ] Create `/api/links` endpoint (CRUD for trackable links)
- [ ] Create `/api/track` endpoint (location data capture)
- [ ] Create `/api/locations` endpoint (location data management)
- [ ] Create `/api/locations/[id]` endpoint (delete specific location)

## Phase 3: Core Pages

- [ ] LocationList component (list and delete locations)

## Phase 5: Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Phase 6: Build & Testing
- [ ] Build application with `pnpm run build --no-lint`
- [ ] Start production server with `pnpm start`
- [ ] API testing with curl commands
- [ ] Location tracking functionality testing
- [ ] Dashboard and map functionality testing

## Phase 7: Final Polish
- [ ] UI/UX enhancements
- [ ] Responsive design verification
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Deploy and provide preview URL
